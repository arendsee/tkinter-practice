# tkinter test app

This is a practice repository. The commit messages will act as a log of my
progress and a medium for recording what I have learned at each step.

Here is a partial list of resources I am using:

 * [tkdocs](http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) - a well-crafted
   tutorial that, in Python style, emphasizes the one right way of doing it.

 * [Thinking in Tkinter](http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/) - tkl has
   developed a lot since this was written, but its intuitive approach and
   bloatless format makes it worthy of study.
